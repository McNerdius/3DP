VSC Key - 

I'd been keeping an eye on mechanical keyboards for a while, but finding something with an appealing layout, available to buy, and within budget proved difficult.  Before now, the [Kono Kira](https://kono.store/products/kira-mechanical-keyboard) is what i had my eye on, the layout being ideal.  I'd been using a cheapo Logitech K360 for ages.  Some key traits: Wireless; Numpad; Nearby arrow keys; somewhat compact, despite the numpad.  I tried out a [Velocifire TKL02](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07DFBKYT5) for a few months but the lack of numpad and more distant arrow keys was a compromise, to say the least.

Early in the month i stumbled upon the [Vortex Tab 90](https://mechanicalkeyboards.com/shop/index.php?l=product_detail&p=4557):

It matches the key traits of the K360 it's replacing, makes the navigation keys more accessible, is in stock and $120 less than the Kira despite a more appealing layout.  It's about one row wider but 1-2 rows shorter front-to-back.  I like the light, monochrome DSA-family keycaps.  I rearranged some keys and used the included blue enter key to brighten things up a bit, which brings me to this project: my personal touch, the [VS Code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_Studio_Code) `Esc` key.  The keyboard now gives off a Lego / Graph Paper / 8-bit vibe, which i like.  ðŸ˜€  Anyhoo, [the design]() is very simple, based on [Minimalist cherry mx keycap](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2766779/files) on thingiverse.
