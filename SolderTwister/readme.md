trying and failing to make a thingy to wrap solder around and 'dispense'

based on a model i stumbled upon named 'solder tube holder' - see 'original' folder.  can't find a link to it on thingiverse.

it has a 5mm diameter, i'm trying to make a fatter one so as to 'hold' more solder.  it seems the increased surface area increases friction and borks the whole thing.
