Most of the time a 3D print is part of a larger project.  But sometimes a print is just a print.  This repo is home to my "just a print" models.

As i move from using vanilla OpenSCAD to my SharpSCAD wrapper library, i've been restructuring the repo to a "monoproject" sort of thing.  Models will be surfaced in the `Karmatach.ThreeDeePee` namespace, with model-specific types in their namespace if need be.  (`Karmatach` is sorta my [Contoso](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/enterprise/contoso-case-study)).  SharpSCAD isn't open sourced yet - there is a lot of work to be done, much churn will happen.  I'll be making it available via nuget soonish, though.  Until then i'll do my best to keep the latest *.scad and *.stl alongside the *.cs files using SharpSCAD.
